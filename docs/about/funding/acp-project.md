# ACP Project

In early 2020, the OpenCDMS project received four and a half years of basic funding as part of the [Intra-ACP Climate Services and Related Applications](https://public.wmo.int/en/projects/intra-acp-climate-services-and-related-applications-climsa) project. Activity 2.4 of the ACP funding aims to enhance climate data management and related applications and to establish and strengthen CDMSs in [African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_African,_Caribbean_and_Pacific_States) countries. The activity is further broken into four parts:

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>2.4.1 Develop recommendations regarding sustainable CDMS requirements for developing country NMHSs;
<li>2.4.2 Design and test an Open Source CDMS;
<li>2.4.3 Support the implementation of a CDMS in the seven regional focus countries; providing limited equipment at the country level in the seven regional focus countries to support implementation of a CDMS;
<li>2.4.4 Conduct seven regional training events on CDMS so the RCCs may support implementation of the Open Source CDMS at the national level.
</ul>

The requirements gathering exercise in activity 2.4.1 has been completed by the OpenCDMS ACP Project Requirements Working Group

<!-- TODO -->

Initial work to design and test an Open Source CDMS for activity 2.4.2 has begun in the [Project Technical Team (PTT)](/groups/project_technical_team) with responsibility for delivery falling to different working groups therein.
