### API

Unless otherwise stated, Application Programming Interface (API) refers to a Web REST API that follows the OpenAPI specification.

### Climate

In the context of Climate Data Management Systems (CDMS), the term “climate” is considered to capture a very broad range of environmental variables, e.g. the GCOS Essential Climate Variables (ECVs)

### Climate Data Model (CDM) Standard
 
OpenCDMS is a Reference Implementation of the WMO Climate Data Model (CDM) Standard which standardizes the representation, exchange and archival of climate data. The CDM is developed an managed by the WMO [Task Team on Climate Data Management](https://github.com/wmo-im/tt-cdm/blob/main/README.md)

### Climate Data Management System (CDMS)

A CDMS is defined in the WMO Climate Data Management System Specifications as "an integrated computer-based system that facilitates the effective archival, management, analysis, delivery and utilization of a wide range of integrated climate data".

### Design pattern

Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design problems. Design patterns are like reusable templates that can be applied to solve real-world problems.

### Framework

Unless otherwise specified, framework refers to a web application framework. This includes both client-side Javascript frameworks and server-side frameworks. Frameworks differ from software libraries by utilising inversion of control.

### Grammar

Use of the term grammar within the project is usually in reference to The Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson.

### Library API

A Library API describes the interface to a software library. This prescribes the behaviour that is expected when using the public classes and methods of the software.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#Libraries_and_frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API#Libraries_and_frameworks)

### Open

In the context of OpenCDMS, the term “open” primarily refers to the creation and adoption of open standards for the management and exchange of data. The OpenCDMS software solution is intend to be a Reference Implementation for relevant standards. Software developed by the project will be made available as open-source software.

### Open-source

Software released under an open-source license as defined by the Open Source Initiative in the Open Source Definition.

[https://opensource.org/osd](https://opensource.org/osd)

### Process

Within the OpenCDMS project, the term process is used to refer to an isolated, reusable and testable module of code. Each process can be treated as a black box, where the implementation does not need to be known, as long as the process behaves as defined in it’s documentation (docstring) and passes the related automated tests. In OpenCDMS, processes allow the reuse of capabilities from external systems without requiring these to be rewritten.

### Product owner

The product owner manages the product backlog (the software development work to be undertaken) and prioritises these in order to achieve the goals and deliver the maximum possible value.

### Reference Implementation

A program that implements all requirements from a corresponding specification. The reference implementation often accompanies a technical standard, and demonstrates what should be considered the "correct" behavior of any other implementation of it.
