The OpenCDMS Project continues to need assistance with software development.

##### Front end

The [opencdms-app](https://github.com/opencdms/opencdms-app) web-based user interface is being developed using VueJS 3 and Vuetify 3. We would welcome any developers willing to help with development using these frameworks.

##### Back end

The core [opencdms](https://github.com/opencdms/opencdms) sofware that runs server-side is predominantly writting using Python with additional plugin processes developed in other languages including R.

Experience, or an interest in, SQLAlchemy, Flask or Pandas would also be useful.

##### System admin

We would also welcome help with system adminstation including Linux, Docker and PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB.

The majority of software developed for the project is available under the [agreed open-source license](/about/license). Developers will also need to sign a Contributor's Licence Agreement (CLA) which authorises the project to use your contribution. More details are [available on request](/about/contact).
