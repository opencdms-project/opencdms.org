The OpenCDMS Project continues to need assistance with software development.

The main programming languages used are Python and R.
Experience, or an interest in, SQLAlchemy, Flask or Pandas would also be useful.

Additionally, the opencdms-app web-based user interface is being developed using VueJS and Vuetify.

We would also welcome help with system adminstation including Linux, Docker and PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB.

The majority of software developed for the project is available under the [agreed open-source license](/about/license). Developers will also need to sign a Contributor's Licence Agreement (CLA) which authorises the project to use your contribution. More details are [available on request](/about/contact).
