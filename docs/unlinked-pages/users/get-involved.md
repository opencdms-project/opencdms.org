The OpenCDMS Project needs help from users interested in the following areas:

##### Requirements gathering

Help us to understand and document the requirements of the next-generation of CDMSs based on your experience of existing solutions.

##### Software testing

Testing will initially be restricted to a limited number of focus countries, however users who are actively involved in the project will be welcome to also test out earlier versions of the software.

##### Documentation

Help will be needed writing the user documentation and also providing translations of material into different languages.
