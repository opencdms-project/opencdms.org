## Responsibilities

The Project Advisory Team (PAT) is comparable to a stakeholder group. The team represents users and the wider membership and advises on project activities and coordination.

The terms of reference for the PAT have not yet been defined but are likely to include:

1. Advising the Project Management Committee on matters concerning strategy and governance
2. Reviewing policies and practices of partner organisations and reporting how these impact on the project
3. Determining metrics to measure the success of the project and monitoring progress against metrics
4. Ensuring that all activities align with the project’s principles and objectives
