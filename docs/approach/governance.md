# Project Structure and Governance

This section will be updated with an ascii art
depiction of the governance structure, possibly
using ditaa in plantuml

The OpenCDMS [Project Management Committee (PMC)](/approach/groups/project-management-committee) was established in September 2020. At this time all members of the original OpenCDMS community automatically joined the Project Advisory Team.

The [Project Advisory Team (PAT)](/approach/groups/project-advisory-team) provides an interface to external communities. The [Project Technical Team (PTT)](/approach/groups/project-technical-team) takes requirements, works on the software design and oversees the implementation.

The Project Management Committee performs a mediation role, resolving any disputes that may arise and reporting progress to the OpenWIS Association

The high-level teams hold overall accountability for the success of the project and software, but much of the responsibility for specific outcomes is handled within sub-groups and working groups. This ensures that tasks and responsibilities are well-defined.
